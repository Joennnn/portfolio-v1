          <p>
            Hello! My name Joen and I enjoy learning and creating things that interest me. 
            My interest in IT started back in secondary schoole when I decided to try hosting servers
            on minecraft to play with my friends â€” turns out searching for ways to host a Minecraft server 
            has spark a deep curiosity in all things web-related.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, I've had the privilege of working as
            <span className='animateHover'>
              <a href="https://themeetinglab.eventsair.com/atcsa-website/"> a freelance for ATCSA </a>
            </span> 
            and 
            <span className='animateHover'>
              <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/"> a Data Analyst for Group-IB</a>
            </span>. 
            Working at these places has only 
            made me more passionate in improving myself and using what I learnt to create new things.
